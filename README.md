# UFOs
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose
My client, Dana, desires to utilize data of UFO sightings to build an interactive webpage that allows users to parse information. To help her do this, I created a webpage and dynamic table that allows users to filter their search criteria for a given UFO sighting contained within the data source based on the following: date, city, state, country, and shape.
## Results
### Utilizing the Search Criteria on the Webpage
* Users can re-initialize their search by clicking on the navigation bar at the top left, which reads "UFO Sightings".

* To filter the UFO data based on sighting date, the user can input their date of interest in the "Enter Date" area of the table. Their change of date is detected and the table is adjusted accordingly. In the image below, the date "1/6/2010" was entered and the table only displays this sighting date.

* All filters can be entered simultaneously by the user to obtain specific UFO data. In the image below the following was entered: "1/1/2010" for date, "la mesa" for city, "ca" for state, "us" for country, and "triangle" for shape. These changes are detected and the table is adjusted accordingly.

## Summary
### Drawbacks
This webpage design has several drawbacks. The most notable one is the inability for the user to enter filtering criteria
